# Enigma_simulator

My python simulator of M3 Enigma

python Enigma_mt_M3.py UKW LEFT MIDDLE RIGHT PLUGBOARD RING GRUND [Debug]

Example :

python Enigma_M3_mt.py B II IV III AC:YX:HR:QW:NM TGF WSW DEBUG < test.txt






Special thanks to [“JF Bouchaudy”](http://jfbouch.fr) and his great site.

My Simulator is very similar to his but I changed it somehow i think is better.
DEBUG format was changed and data structure used in rotor class was changed.
I think my simulator is so easier to understand and I used his Rotors data Base.
